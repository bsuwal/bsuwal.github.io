          <p>I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Tufts University in Boston. I'm currently interested in reinforcement learning and Bayesian modeling. </p><p>I am currently looking for full-time statistical/software positions for after I graduate in May 2019. The best way to reach me is at bhushan.suwal@tufts.edu. </p>

          <h3>I am proud to have worked on some cool projects.</h3>
          <ul>For my reinforcement learning class, I used a reinforcement learning technique to remove bias from a trained NLP model. <a href= "/assets/about/RL_FinalReport.pdf">[Paper]</a><a href="https://github.com/asavage1/sentence_completion">[Code]</a></ul>
          <ul>SyncLights, where we make LED strips synchronize with music. We have deployed this system at an I House party at Tufts! Video to follow soon. <a href="https://github.com/bsuwal/SyncingLights">[Code (and preliminary video)]</a></ul>
          
          <h3>Also, I am super psyched to be running the Boston Marathon this April!!! I am fund-raising for the Friedman School at Tufts to support research on some the world's most pressing issues on nutrition. <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/donate/project/tuftsboston2019/tufts">Support me here!</a></h3> </p>
