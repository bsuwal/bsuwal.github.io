    <h2> Bhushan Suwal </h2>
    <p>
    I am an associate researcher at the
    <a href="https://mggg.org">MGGG Redistricting Lab</a> at Tufts University's
    <a href="https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/">Tisch College of Civic Life</a>
    led by <a href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/">Moon Duchin</a>.

    My work is broadly on the computational problems surrounding redistricting
    and US voting rights. More generally, I am interested in algorithmic fairness.
    <br>
    <br>
    I graduated in 2019 from Tufts University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am based in Somerville, MA.</p>

    <i>Developer and Maintainer</i><br>
    An open-source Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to generate ensembles of redistricting plans,
    in the Julia programming language. Developed with Parker Rule and Matthew Sun. I was also
    a Google Summer of Code 2020 mentor for this project.
