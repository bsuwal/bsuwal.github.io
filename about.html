          I am Bhushan, and my current interests are broadly in 
          statistics and computational social science. I am currently involved in research around the problems of gerrymandering and US voting rights at <a href="https://mggg.org">MGGG</a>.
          <p>I enjoy running. I also really enjoy the idea of reading books, and buy a lot of them. Someday, I hope to get around to reading them!</p>
          <p>I graduated in May from Tufts University with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
          <p>I am based in Somerville, MA.</p>
