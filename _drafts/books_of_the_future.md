** Outline
    why i write in english
    what my actual voice sounds like
    who i am most comfortable speaking to

    where nepali ness is headed to
    snap of my fingers
    it really depends on what i am talking about
    not unlikely that this is what the future of popular nepali writing can be like

Not infrequently, I read writing advice along the lines of 'Write in your own voice!' and 'Write as you speak!'. I see the motivation behind this and it bodes well for my own writing errands, which like in this blog, is to be approachable and relatable. However, this also begs the question, what does the voice in my head sound like??

Which turns out was a harder question than I would have liked. And its not about how I think, I think I just type whatever is in my head, but it was more about what bhasa i thought in. kinaki turns out for certain things, the language in my head is strictly English. This is stuff like when i think about politics, like women rights and freedom of speech and the goods and perils of capitalism. i think it is because i seem to disproportionately hear about these things only from English speaking people, so much so that the voice in my head is spattering english left and right when i think of these things. 

i consider myself pretty bilingual, but i think the language i am most comfortable in is nepali with a healthy splattering of english. nepali ma sentence start garne ani bistarai autocomplete mode ma chai i switch to english as if they are the same mf bhasa. esko lagi dherai reason haru chan, ani a big one i think is that i cant type in nepali if my life depended on it, tei bhaera english characters matrai use garnu parera pani its so easy to switch into the english mode. 

nepali matra bolna khoju bhane ni bich bich ma english sabda ra phrases haru pyach pyach chirihalcha, english matra gare bhane its alikati more cognitive effort than i would like. aile yo post jasari nai sadhai lekhna paeko bhae kati sajilo hunthyo. 

i realize that this is a niche thing, my ideal audience being nepali origin people who are perhaps first generation immigrants/visitors to amrika or australia and speak my tongue. tara this is increasingly getting more common as more and more nepalis leave the motherland. this is increasinlgy the bhasa of the 21st century bougie nepali. 

medium is a strong influence. *** nepali type start** nepali mai type garyo bhane chai sajilo huncha nepali sabda matra prayo garna. ** end**  english keyboard mai nepali lekhna fararara jancha, its almost second nature. * start ** now think of the other way round where this is fucking awkward to read and even more awkward to type. * end * all of this means that the diaspora kids are writing and consuming Nepali with a healthy Splatter of English like dudhbhat.

all this considered, it is not unusual to think that as the Nepali diaspora grows, there might be books in the future targeted towards us that write in the jhilimili tarika that I am so confortable with. not with the fancy italics where the * highlighted * bideshi sabdaharu * are highlighted to stand out, but sabdaharu in their own stand as if that is just how the bhasa has become, so much so that padne bela ma pani i hear a nepali accent reading it to me. i dont know if it will happen, im just saying it will be unsurprising.
