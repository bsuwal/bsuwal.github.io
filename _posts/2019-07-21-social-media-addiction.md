People who have known me for a while know how much I whine about being addicted to social media. I am going to pick the battle up one more time, and this time I intend to win the fight. 

The best way to contact me for the time being is through my phone number or my email address bhushan_suwal@live.com. I intend to return to some degree of social media use in the future.

### A quick word on my motivations. 
Used properly I have no doubt that social media would be a net positive on my life. I have friendships I cherish today that have been possible solely because of social media interactions, and I even got my internship at IRobot through Twitter. The positives are not lost on me, just as I am sure the possible negatives are not lost on you.

It is my repeated inability to consume it in responsible amounts that makes me take steps like these. I have spent a non-trivial amount of thought on this decision.

### Past attempts, with varying levels of success
For years now I have tried all kinds of weird schemes to keep me off of social media. Some that I can recall right now are:
* I had page blockers on my browser, but they were too convenient to turn off. 
* I decided to have a seperate browser solely for procastination purposes, so I could sandbox my work on one browser without the distraction of a social media tab on the same browser. This remarkably worked for a while until I ended up perpetually having two browsers open. 
* I have spent weeks without logging in during vacations. But coming back to a college/work environment makes me lose all of this progress instantly. Such relapses triggered by a return to the original environment have been documented for other forms of more serious addictions, so I am not surprised. 
* For quite a while, I have been logging out of FB and Twitter on my browser and asked the browser to not save my passwords. The intention was that the additional hassle of typing my passwords each time would discourage me from logging in. Turns out I would rather type my passwords tens of times a day rather than miss out the hour-to-hour happenings of the Twittersphere.
* I deleted all the apps from my phone a long time ago. I ended up using the browser on my phone for them, so essentially I was using a poorer interface for the same amount of time spent. 
* The move that actually paid off was when I logged out of my email from my phone. Email, in hindsight, was a gateway drug for my usage, where I would be like "Ok, I am checking my email anyway, might as well open a new tab and check the feeds". I have since realized that in the past year I think I received an urgent email a grand total of 0 times, meaning that I had no business checking my email on my phone. Once I did this I stopped checking FB and Twitter on my phone too.
* I went so far as to delete my Facebook for an entire month in 2018 during college, and I lost a decade's worth of interactions. Even though deleting it then made me feel like I was throwing away a log of so many of my memories, I have not regretted it once. Not being on FB is a hassle though, and I finally gave in when I desperately needed a summer sublet and FB housing groups are the best mediums for those. My usage spiked back up to astronomical amounts in no time. 
* Similarly, I deleted Instagram and Snapchat in 2017 (or was it 2018?) and felt some non-trivial withdrawl symptoms then. Instagram especially was quite an unhealthy time sink, and I am glad that I am not on it anymore.

### Current Strategy
* I have changed the passwords of my FB and Twitter to random hashes that I have not saved anywhere. I couldn't log in if I wanted to. The only way to go back would be to use the "Forgot Password?" option, which might actually be the barrier that might be too high. For now, I intend to not log back onto either of these until the end of August 2019. 
* I actually love Twitter. I have aggressively curated it to show only content I actually care for and unfollow all accounts that get into toxic arguments. The only reason I have cracked down on it is because I'm positive it would serve as my gateway drug to Facebook. Better to take no chances and evaluate later. 
* The only actual inconvenience is that I have decided to throw away Messenger too. Again, for gateway drug reasons. I currently intend to be back on it once I have a better control of my usage. 

I am also a huge fan of Google's Digital Wellbeing Initiative. It means that on my Pixel I have a built in app that allows me to see how I have been using my time on the phone. My current usage is about an hour on a bad day, which is a HUGE improvement over the numbers of 3-4 hours I was hitting at the end of 2017. I do realize that a part of this is because my social media usage has just shifted to my laptop, however I am content. Most of my phone time is currently on Spotify and Messages, which I don't mind. 

I intend to update this blog post periodically as a record of progress / relapse.
