I was reading Leonard Mlodinow’s book The Drunkard’s Walk the other day, and he mentioned this great idea that I thought I should share to all of my 3 readers.

In one of the chapters, Leonard talks about how conditional probability is not an intuition that we have evolved to deal with very well. He points out this specific example about texting someone we are interested in. 

Often, the thought process goes: Since they did not text us back, they are probably not interested in us. If they were interested in us, they would have texted us back quickly, right?

Here is where we make our error:
The probability that they would not respond to us quickly given that they are not interested is high. But the probability that they are not interested given that they didn’t respond to us quickly is nowhere near as high. The absolute ground truth we know in this case is that they did not respond to us. That could have been for a host of reasons: they could have been in a class, they could have lost their phone, their phone may have died etc etc. The competing sample space here is just a lot more bigger. 

The point here is that we confuse P(not interested in us | didn’t text us fast) with P(didn’t text us fast | not interested in us). The second one has a far higher probability, and because our mind stops being rational when it comes to people of interest we slip over to that side. The first one is what our actual scenario is, and that probability is considerably lower.

I wish you more happiness the next time they don’t text you back. :)
