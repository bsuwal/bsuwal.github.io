This week has brought forth deeply disturbing incidents of inequality in our world. The murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a police officer has started riots all over the country. साथ साथै, रुकुममा पनि जातिय भेदभावको कारणले नवराज वि.क. र उसका साथीहरुको हत्या भयो \| मैले दुइ कथाको मात्रै नाम लिए, तर दुखको सत्य के हो भने एस्ता कथा संसारका यी दुवै कुनामा धेरै समयदेखि थुप्रिदै आएका छन \| I have personally been feeling very overwhelmed, तर त्यो आफ्नै ठाउँमा छ \| At some point, I also need to talk to my बहिनी about these deep systemic inequalities that permeate much of our society.

बहिनीलाइ के भन्ने सोच्ने सिलसिलामा I had to confront one of the utter ironies of Budhanilkantha School, which I happen to also have attended before her. For a school that will wax lyrical about its anti-caste roll number system, I think it failed me in the education of the many caste-related inequalities in our society.

I want to preface this by saying that I believe what BNKS is currently doing is being done in good faith. I genuinely believe that the people who set the replace-last-name-with-roll-number rule believed that it was the best way to make for an equal experience. I believed in it myself so much that I actually wrote about it in one of my college essays, तर my opinions have changed since then. At the very least, I believe it is beneficial to consider the costs of this system. At its worst, I believe that the entire premise the roll number system stands on doesn't work.

Budhanilkanthaले caste based discrimination tackle गर्न एकदम peculiar method use गरेको छ - and that is by completely ignoring it. Caste को कुरा नगरम \| नगरम मात्रै हैन, so far such कि गर्न नै मनाही छ \| School कै rulebooks मै छ कि छैन त थाहा छैन, तर it sure did feel any discussion about caste was going against the ethos of the school. Which was fine, जिन्दगी चलेकै थियो, हास्खेल रमाइलो नै थियो \| किन कुरा गर्नु जात-भातको? Budhanilkantha को भित्ता भित्र जात छैन \|

तर भित्ता बाहिर त छ \| नवराज वि.क.हरु मरिरहेकै छन् \| Ignoring this problem does not make it go away. मेरो बिचारमा this is precisely what makes this avoid-talking-about-caste system so dangerous, because it seems like the easy way out. How can you talk about this problem when you don't even acknowledge it within the school? If we intend to produce graduates that are responsible, conscious people, how can we not talk about one of the most entrenched systems of our society?

I wouldn't say that the roll-number system attempts to rewrite our history, तर it unapologetically is an attempt to ignore it.

केहि समय अगाडी मैले Franceको बारेमा पढ्दै थिए, where it is illegal to tabulate the race of a person. The government has no record of the race of the person. The census does not ask you for your race. This is rooted with good intention, किनकि official records were abused by the Nazis to find Jews when they took over France, अनि this system is a way to ensure that such a thing never happens again. But that also means कि France मा racial inequality को बारेमा कुरा गर्ने तथ्यांकहरु नै छैनन् \|  त्यसको अर्थ यो हैन कि त्यो देशमा racial inequality नै छैन \| BNKS मा पनि त्यहि सरि भएको लाग्छ मलाई, systemले नै caste-inequalityको कुरा गर्ने वातावरण दिएको छैन, तर त्यो भन्दैमै यो समस्या नभएको हैन \|

There is an intrinsic message to removing the last name -- हामी सर्वप्रथम मान्छे हौ \| यो messagingसंग मेरो अदभुत सहमति छ \| The idea that we are Nepali first is implicit in the roll-number system. तर what is this image of Nepali, that the school impresses upon its students? यसको पनि ख्याल गरौ \| When they think of a Nepali man, is he wearing a दाउरा-सुरुवाल? Do the boys from Madhesh proudly wear a धोती-कुर्ता when they are graduating, like the boys from the Pahad? Are students proud and comfortable to be Dalit and Madhesi? Do their Pahadi/Bahun/Chhetri peers realize the prejudice their classmates will have to face when they graduate? Do they understand how to confront their own family members if they make discriminatory remarks? हाम्रो देशको इतिहाशमा Madesh र Dalitहरु पटक पटक systematically थिच्चिएका छन् भनेर do they realize? I know I didn't.

In insisting that everyone is treated the same, we will inevitably erase the identities of some groups, and it seems to disproportionately affect the castes that the system is intended to help in the first place.

Schoolले intentionally यो message दिन खोज्दैछ भनेर मेरो सोच हैन \| I think this is more of a general trend in Kathmandu and Nepal in general, अनि BNKS is but riding that wave. But that doesn't mean that it is correct, and in the silence of the school in correcting for this trend the school has endorsed it.

School भित्रै पनि, does caste affect your experience? This is an entire can of worms I do not intend to open and unpack, र यी समुदायबाट म आफै नभएकाले यसकोबारे कुरा गर्ने मेरो ठाउँ नि होइन \| I know that it does. While the world is the way it is, it always will. The bigger question is -- do these students have the space to talk about these issues? थरको कुरा गर्न नपाइने schoolमा?

Circling back. How do we talk to these students about the Dalit lynchings? कि कुरै नगर्ने हो, फेरी पनि? राजाको छोरा-छोरी र दलितका छोरा-छोरी उही लुगा लगाएर classमा पढेको भनेर सायद मैले सय चोटी सुने होला \| तर at the end of the day त्यो दलित studentले Facebook मा आफ्नो थर नै राख्ने आट गरेन भने, I feel like we have failed that student.

हामी Budhanilkantha पढेकालाई हाम्रो roll number निकै प्यारो छ \| आफ्नो roll number emailमा कि phoneको unlock pinमा नराखेको त कुन चै Budhanilkantha alum छ र? I am not saying we should do away with them. I do however think it is important to understand the drawbacks of this system, who it is affecting, and how it has shaped the culture of the school. Discussions on caste identity and about how caste has shaped our society can, I believe, co-exist with the roll number system. How to roll-out such a programme and environment to school kids who come from all kinds of backgrounds is a difficult question that I am not qualified to answer. However, patting itself on the back about the supposed merits of the roll number system while dodging the hard work required to actually educate the students is, in my opinion, something the school should be questioning itself strongly about.
