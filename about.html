          <div class = "about-header"> <p> Hi I am Bhushan, and I go to Tufts.</p><hr></div>
          <p>I am a sophomore here, and am studying Computer Science. I am still deciding what this blog will be about. I think I will find what I want to write about a few blog posts down the line, but for, but for now I am happy to just write whatever I fancy.</p>
          <p>I grew up in Nepal, where I spent much of my youth in a cool boarding school.</p>
          <p>I have no clue what I want to do eventually do in my life. I have interests in renewable energy, data science, travel tech and development in developing economies. Or whatever book I happen to be reading about at the moment, which is Probability right now. Damn Probability is cool.</p>
          <p>I really enjoy travelling. I trekked the Annapurna Circuit at 5500m this last summer, and then backpacked through Mexico this winter.</p>
          <p>I follow European football and try to watch as many Chelsea FC games as I can.</p>
