Conditional probability is unintuitive. Which is fine, an unfortunate number of things are. But the especially nasty bit about conditional probability is that it appears intuitive, whereas this slippery eel is anything but.

Let's demonstrate this with this puzzle from Daniel Kahneman's book Thinking Fast and Slow:
An individual has been described by a neighbor as follows: “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with very little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.” Is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?

Kahneman says that most people say that Steve is a librarian. They fail to take into consideration that the population of male farmers is 20 times that of male librarians in the US. Taking this base rate into account, it is more probable that Steve is a farmer. Just because Steve resembles a librarian more than a farmer doesn't necessarily make him more likely to be a librarian. P(librarian|shy) is nowhere near as high as P(shy|librarian).

Cheatsheet:
P(A|B) is the probability of A occuring given that B has already happened.

Most accidents occur within 25 miles from home; therefore, you are safest when you are far from home.
Terrorists tend to have an engineering background; so, engineers have a tendency towards terrorism.

I realized that we make errors like this on a daily basis more often than I thought.
